# Markup Languages. Introduction to LaTeX

## What are markup languages?  
Markup languages are designed to structure and format text. They are used in web development, technical documentation, scientific papers, and even in everyday notes.  

Some popular markup languages include:  
- **HTML** — the foundation of web pages, enabling the creation of structured documents with multimedia content.  
- **Markdown** — a simple and lightweight language for documentation, blogs, and notes.  
- **LaTeX** — a powerful typesetting system, especially popular among scientists and engineers.  

## What makes LaTeX special?  
LaTeX is not just a markup language but a full-fledged document preparation system. Unlike regular text editors, it uses a declarative approach: the author defines the structure of the document, and LaTeX takes care of formatting it properly.  

Key advantages of LaTeX:  
- **Professional typography**. Documents look polished without extra effort.  
- **Advanced handling of mathematical formulas**. This makes it the standard in the scientific community.  
- **Flexibility and modularity**. Packages can be used to extend functionality.  
- **Automated formatting**. Headings, lists, bibliographies, references, and tables of contents are generated automatically.  

## Where is LaTeX used?  
LaTeX is widely applied in scientific and technical fields:  
- Writing theses and coursework.  
- Preparing scientific articles and books.  
- Creating technical documentation and presentations.  

Although LaTeX requires time to learn, its capabilities make it an indispensable tool for working with text where precision and high-quality typesetting are essential.
