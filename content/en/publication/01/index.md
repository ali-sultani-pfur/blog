# üîÑ Version Control. Git  

## What is version control?  

Version control is the process of tracking and managing changes in code. This is especially important for teamwork, when multiple developers are making edits to the same project.  

**Why is it important?**  
- ‚úÖ Allows you to roll back to a previous version of the code  
- ‚úÖ Helps track changes and their authors  
- ‚úÖ Simplifies collaborative development  

## Git ‚Äì the main version control tool  

Git is the most popular distributed version control system (VCS). It is used by developers worldwide and forms the backbone of platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.  

### üîπ Core principles of Git  

1. **Local and remote repositories**  
   - Git stores all changes in a **local repository** on your computer.  
   - The repository can be synchronized with a **remote server**, such as GitHub.  

2. **Commits and change history**  
   - A **commit** is saving changes to the project‚Äôs history.  
   - Each commit has a unique **hash** (identifier), making it easy to track modifications.  

3. **Branching and merging**  
   - Git allows you to create **branches** to work on new features without breaking the main code.  
   - Once the work is done, the branch can be **merged** into the main one.  

4. **Conflict resolution**  
   - If two developers edit the same file, a **conflict** may occur.  
   - Git lets you manually choose which changes to keep.  

5. **Team collaboration**  
   - Developers make changes in **their own branches**.  
   - After code review, changes are **merged** into the main branch.  
   - This prevents chaos in the code and makes quality control easier.  

## Why is Git better than just copying files?  

| Storage method             | Version control | Rollback option | Team collaboration |  
|-----------------------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|  
| Simple file copying         | ‚ùå No           | ‚ùå No           | ‚ùå No              |  
| Git                         | ‚úÖ Yes          | ‚úÖ Yes          | ‚úÖ Yes             |  

## Conclusion  

Git is a powerful tool for version control. If you are developing software, learning Git is an essential skill!
