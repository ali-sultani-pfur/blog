# 🧑‍💻 Guide: How to Make a Proper Scientific Presentation (Not Just a Set of Slides)

If your task is to prepare a **scientific presentation** — for a class, project defense, or a conference — simply copying text from your report into PowerPoint no longer works.  

Here’s a simple yet effective framework that will help you stay within the time limit and convey your message clearly.

## 🧱 1. Presentation Structure

### 🔹 Slide 1 — Title  
- Title of the work (the shorter and clearer, the better).  
- Name, program, supervisor (if required).  
- Date/event (e.g., “IT Department Conference,” “Project Pre-defense”).  

### 🔹 Slide 2 — Relevance  
Why is the topic important? Where is it applied? What problems does it solve? One slide — max two short paragraphs + an illustration/diagram.  

### 🔹 Slide 3 — Aim and Objectives  
- Clearly state: *“The aim is to develop…”*  
- And list objectives: *“1. Research…, 2. Implement…, 3. Test…”*  

### 🔹 Slides 4–6 — Main Part  
- Briefly about methods, algorithms, architecture.  
- Add a diagram or code snippet (don’t overload with text).  
- Show **what you did**, not only what you *read about*.  

### 🔹 Slides 7–8 — Results  
- Tables, graphs, screenshots.  
- Short analysis: what worked, what advantages you achieved.  

### 🔹 Final Slide — Conclusions  
- What was achieved?  
- What are the limitations?  
- What can be improved in the future?

## 🛠 2. Design: Minimalism Wins

- **Color palette** — 2–3 colors, avoid too much variety.  
- **Font** — readable (no smaller than 18 pt).  
- **Graphics** — diagrams and visuals are better than plain text.  
- Don’t fear whitespace — less text, more clarity.

## 💡 3. Content ≠ Copy-Paste  

- Don’t paste paragraphs from the report. Reframe them as short bullet points.  
- One slide = one idea. No overload.  
- Visualize data: charts are better than tables.

## 🗣 4. Presentation Tips  

- Rehearse at least once. With a timer.  
- Speak in your own words, don’t read from the screen.  
- Know what’s on each slide and why it’s there.

## ✅ Conclusion  

A good scientific presentation makes it clear **what you did, why, and how it works**. Everything else — style, graphics, special effects — is secondary.  

First comes logic, then design. This rule always works.
