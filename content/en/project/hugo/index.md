# Why does a researcher need a personal website in 2025?  

Imagine: you publish an article, speak at a conference, or launch a course. Where can people quickly find all this information? Randomly through social media? By chance in search engines? The most convenient place is on your own website.  

Today, a personal website is not a luxury or “just for show.” It’s as much a part of academic life as publishing papers or participating in research projects.  

This is where **Hugo Academic** comes in — a tool that lets you build a modern researcher’s website without the hassle.

- 🎨 Clean, modern design out of the box.  

In short, grab your laptop, write some Markdown, and you’ve got yourself an academic “home” online.

## What can you put on the website?  

- **Publications**: articles, books, preprints with nice cards and PDF links.  
- **Projects**: share what you’re working on and the results you’ve achieved.  
- **Teaching**: courses, schedules, materials for students.  
- **News and blog**: updates about conferences, research, or just personal insights.  
- **Resume (CV)**: always up-to-date and accessible.  

So, your site becomes both a business card, an archive, and a news feed.
