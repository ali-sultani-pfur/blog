## 📅 Weekly Highlights  

This week was both engaging and productive:  

- 📘 Started preparing for the new semester – revisiting the basics of **algorithms** and **data structures**.  
- 💻 Figured out how **GitHub Actions** works – now automating project builds.  
- 🎮 Played a strategy game with friends – a great way to relieve stress.  
- 🏃 Ran 5 km in the park and can feel my endurance improving.  
- ☕ Met with classmates – we discussed study plans for the semester.
