## 📅 Weekly Highlights  

The week went by quickly, and here’s what I managed to do:  

- 🔬 Started preparing for lab sessions on **computer networks**.  
- 🖥 Tested several **machine learning** libraries.  
- 📚 Wrote a summary on linear algebra – will be useful in the future.  
- 🎮 Spent an evening playing a co-op game with friends – it was a great mood booster.  
- 🌆 Took an evening walk around Moscow – the atmosphere was amazing.
